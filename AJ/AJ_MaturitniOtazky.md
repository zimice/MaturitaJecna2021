# 1. Education and learning

#### I would like to talk about my opinion of this subject.

- My way of education
- My path to this school
- How I learn to everyday subjects
- How I spent my freetime learning things I wil need in my future job

## My way of education

        My elementary school have been close to my village and has been the biggest one in whole district.I have been going there for nine years and have enjoyed every day.I have made very close friend there and I hope I will never forget the experience I have got there.First few years I dont really remember learning and subjects, just people and relationships between them.After few years I think in fifth grade I really  started enjoying physics and mathematics mostly because of the way that subjects were taught in interesting way and I felt smarter after each hour.I really liked how world interacts by some basic laws and logical consequences.I really enjoyed czech language from seventh grade too, because i was really keen on literature and finding why people like specific books soo much.I didn't really liked Chemistry and Biology.I never enjoyed hours and quizes on trees and plants and minerals.God, How I hated geology.

## My path to my High school (Medium school)

        In ninth grade I have made a choice to go to Smíchovská střední průmyslová škola or to SPŠE Ječná.I have choosen this school as this was more to my interest because of the electrotechnics subjects.I haven't made it at first term of tests but I kept on trying and eventualy I have been accepted.In semptember 2017 I have started this school and I am looking forward to finish it.As everyone would say, I think there some subjects that are bad which I won't name and there subjects that I liked soo much that In my opinion we were not given enough time at them.And I will never forget on change between ninth grade of Elementary schoool and first grade of High school.The learning was hard and every teacher tried his best to give us all knowledge that is important for studying this school.

## How I learn to everyday subjects

        Every day when I get out of school and come home a revise the subjects that I am interested in.Sometimes I work on school asingments even at midnight or at dawn just because of the passion.Of course sometimes I don't make some homework or thing because I am not interested and I don't want to do it but hear me out.I just do it because I don't consider it beneficial and I like to do something more important to me.

## How I spent my freetime learning things I will need in my future job

        Lets just say and I don't think I am the only one that I do my job in their freetime.If it's making website, 3D modeling , game making, or problem solving with programming complex algorithms.I am not saying that everyone of my classmates focus on this specialization, but instead that small group of students which I won't and can't because of the uncertainty recall.I spent my freetime ordering chips and electrotechnic items Chinese eshops, because I enjoy programming and tinkering with it.
