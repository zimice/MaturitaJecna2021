# 1. Education and learning

#### I would like to talk about my opinion of this subject.

- My way of education
- My path to this school
- How I learn to everyday subjects
- How I spent my freetime learning things I wil need in my future job

## My way of education

         My elementary school have been close to my village and has been the biggest one in whole district.
        I have been going there for nine years and have enjoyed every day.
        I have made very close friend there and I hope I will never forget the experience I have got there.
        First few years I dont really remember learning and subjects, just people and relationships between them.
        After few years I think in fifth grade, I really started enjoying physics and mathematics,
        mostly because of the way that subjects were taught in interesting way,and I felt smarter after each hour.
        I really liked how world interacts by some basic laws and logical consequences.
        I really enjoyed czech language from seventh grade too, because i was really keen on literature,
        and finding why people like specific books soo much.
        I didn't really liked Chemistry and Biology.I never enjoyed hours and quizes on trees and plants and minerals.
        God, How I hated geology.

## My path to my High school (Medium school)

        In ninth grade I have made a choice to go to Smíchovská střední průmyslová škola or to SPŠE Ječná.I have choosen this school as this was more to my interest because of the electrotechnics subjects.I haven't made it at first term of tests but I kept on trying and eventualy I have been accepted.In semptember 2017 I have started this school and I am looking forward to finish it.As everyone would say, I think there some subjects that are bad which I won't name and there subjects that I liked soo much that In my opinion we were not given enough time at them.And I will never forget on change between ninth grade of Elementary schoool and first grade of High school.The learning was hard and every teacher tried his best to give us all knowledge that is important for studying this school.

## How I learn to everyday subjects

        Every day when I get out of school and come home a revise the subjects that I am interested in.Sometimes I work on school asingments even at midnight or at dawn just because of the passion.Of course sometimes I don't make some homework or thing because I am not interested and I don't want to do it but hear me out.I just do it because I don't consider it beneficial and I like to do something more important to me.

## How I spent my freetime learning things I will need in my future job

        Lets just say and I don't think I am the only one that I do my job in their freetime.If it's making website, 3D modeling , game making, or problem solving with programming complex algorithms.I am not saying that everyone of my classmates focus on this specialization, but instead that small group of students which I won't and can't because of the uncertainty recall.I spent my freetime ordering chips and electrotechnic items Chinese eshops, because I enjoy programming and tinkering with it.

        other 14% people speak other languages like chinese, korean, french 

## Now i am going to talk somthing about history

        The first known use of the name "America" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world 
        map created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller. In 1538, the Flemish 
        cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name "America" on his own world map.
        The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" dates from a
        January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan, Esquire, to George Washington's
        aide-de-camp (pobočník) Joseph Reed.

## in USA took place  Several wars

        in 1775 - 1783 began American Revolutionary War which established 
        independence. by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal 
        in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the 
        American Civil War led to its abolition.The Spanish–American War and World War I 
        established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of 
        World War II. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged 
        in various proxy wars but avoided direct military conflict

## Let's talk about education in USA

        American public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated 
        by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants.
        In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven
        until they turn 18; some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.
        About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. 
        Just over 2% of children are homeschooled. The U.S. spends more on education per 
        student than any nation in the world, spending an average of $12,794 per year 
        on public elementary and secondary school. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated
        from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and
        9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%

## Now let's move on to goverment and politics

        The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories.
        It is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative
        democracy "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.
        In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of 
        government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly 
        split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive 
        and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district

# 5. The United Kingdom

## Basic information

                 United kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.
                The United Kingdom includes the islad of Great Britain, the northeastern part of the island of Ireland,
                and many smaller islands within the British Isles.The United Kingdom consists of four countries:
                England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland
                which is the independent state.The population is around 66 millions.In the head of United Kingdom is Elizabeth II.
                (who was reigned since 1952 )with current prime minister Boris Johnson.The United Kingdom's capital is London,
                a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 milion.There are also 14 British Overseas Territories,
                the last remnants of British Empire which at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass,
                and was the largest empire in history.British influence can be observed in the language,
                culture and political systems of many of its former colonies.

## important history events

                 On 1. May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed,
                the result of Acts of Union being passed by parliamnets of England and Scotland to ratify the 1706 Treaty of Union,
                and so unite the two kingdoms.Treaty of Union consisted of:

                - Scotland and England should be united into one of name Great Britain 
                - provided Scotland peers to have the same rights as English peers 
                - provided Scotland to be represented in the new Parliament of Great Britain by sixteen of its peers and forty-five members of House of Commons
               
                 The term 'United Kingdom' became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union,
                uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
                After the defeat of France at the end of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815),
                the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century. British dominance was later described as British Peace,
                a period of relative peace among the Great Powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman.

## First World War

                 Britain fought alongside France, Russia and (after 1917) the United States,
                against Germany and its allies in the First World War.British forces were engaged
                across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe,particularly on the Western front.
                The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men,
                with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order.

                 After the war, Britain received the League of Nations mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies.
                The British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.
                Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.
                Interesting fact that I don't think everyone knews is that Anglo-Japanese Alliance that bound (1902-1923)
                Britain and Japan to assist one another in safuarding their respective interest in China and Korea.
                Directed against Russian expansionism in the Far East,it was a cornerstone of British and Japanese policy in Asia
                until after World War I.After the war the British no longer feared Russian encroachment in China
                and wished to maintain close ties with the United States, which tended to view Japan as its rival in the Pacific.

## Second World War

                 After Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Britain entered the Second World War by declaring war on Germany in 1939.
                Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940.
                Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war,
                Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany.

                 Churchill engaged indurstry, scientists, and engineers to advise and support the government
                and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.In 1940 british RAF defeated German Luftwaffe
                in a struggle of controling British skies.Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz.
                British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan an the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea.
                British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project which led to the surrender of Japan.

## Government

                 The United Kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy. Queen Elizabeth II.
                is the monarch and head of the UK, as well as 15 other indepndent countries. These 16 countries
                are sometimes referred to as "Commonwealth realms". The monarch has "the right to be consulted,
                the right to encourage, and the right to warn".The UK Parliament can perform "constitutional reform"
                simply by passing Acts of Parliament,and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost
                any written or unwritten element of the constitution. No Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change

## Characterize the country

                 Firstword some facts:

                - Today the Uk is the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany.
                - There is around 60% chritstian and 25% none.Life expentancy at birth is 80 years.
                - Obesity over people 28% which is worser than Czechia by 3%.
                - Uneployment rate is 3.17% which is insignificantly worser than czechia.

                 The United Kingdom has been born country to many scients and great minds.
                For Example:
                Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science.

                Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology.

                James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory

                And my favorite Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of astronomy,
                quantum gravity and investigation of black holes and black hole evaporation of it called Hawking radiation.

                 Education in United Kingdom is a devolded matter with each country having a separate education system.
                Considering the four systems together, about 38 % of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree,
                Which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.
                I think everyone knows tho major universities: Cambridge and Oxford.In my honest opinion Cambridge is better.
                Stephen Hawking studied there which is the first thing. The architecture is beautiful.I have been there personally,
                and I think the school ground are more sympathic
