# 1. Education and learning

#### I would like to talk about my opinion of this subject.

- My way of education
- My path to this school
- How I learn to everyday subjects
- How I spent my freetime learning things I wil need in my future job

## My way of education

         My elementary school have been close to my village and has been the biggest one in whole district.
        I have been going there for nine years and have enjoyed every day.
        I have made very close friend there and I hope I will never forget the experience I have got there.
        First few years I dont really remember learning and subjects, just people and relationships between them.
        After few years I think in fifth grade, I really started enjoying physics and mathematics,
        mostly because of the way that subjects were taught in interesting way,and I felt smarter after each hour.
        I really liked how world interacts by some basic laws and logical consequences.
        I really enjoyed czech language from seventh grade too, because i was really keen on literature,
        and finding why people like specific books soo much.
        I didn't really liked Chemistry and Biology.I never enjoyed hours and quizes on trees and plants and minerals.
        God, How I hated geology.

## My path to my High school (Medium school)

        In ninth grade I have made a choice to go to Smíchovská střední průmyslová škola or to SPŠE Ječná.I have choosen this school as this was more to my interest because of the electrotechnics subjects.I haven't made it at first term of tests but I kept on trying and eventualy I have been accepted.In semptember 2017 I have started this school and I am looking forward to finish it.As everyone would say, I think there some subjects that are bad which I won't name and there subjects that I liked soo much that In my opinion we were not given enough time at them.And I will never forget on change between ninth grade of Elementary schoool and first grade of High school.The learning was hard and every teacher tried his best to give us all knowledge that is important for studying this school.

## How I learn to everyday subjects

        Every day when I get out of school and come home a revise the subjects that I am interested in.Sometimes I work on school asingments even at midnight or at dawn just because of the passion.Of course sometimes I don't make some homework or thing because I am not interested and I don't want to do it but hear me out.I just do it because I don't consider it beneficial and I like to do something more important to me.

## How I spent my freetime learning things I will need in my future job

        Lets just say and I don't think I am the only one that I do my job in their freetime.If it's making website, 3D modeling , game making, or problem solving with programming complex algorithms.I am not saying that everyone of my classmates focus on this specialization, but instead that small group of students which I won't and can't because of the uncertainty recall.I spent my freetime ordering chips and electrotechnic items Chinese eshops, because I enjoy programming and tinkering with it.

# 3. The Czech Republic

## Basic Information

         The Czech Republic is a landlocked country in Central Europe with population close to 11 mil.
        It is bordered with Austria,Germany,Poland and Slovakia.
        The Czech Republic has hilly lansdscape with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate.
        Czechia ranks as the 27th most environmentally conscious country in the world in Environmental Performance Index.
        And from world factbook the women have longer lifspan than man.

## important history events

         In 1918, during the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of World War I,
        the independent republic of Czechoslovakia,
        which joined the winning Allied powers, was created, with Tomas Garrigue Masaryk in the lead.
        The FIrst Czechoslovak Republic comprosed only 27% of the population of the former Austria-Hungary, but nearly 80% of the industry,
        which enabled it to compete with Western industrial states.
        Czechslovakia was the only democracy in Central Europe during the interwar period.
        Although the First Czechoslovak Republic was a unitary state,
        it provided certain rights to its minorities.

## Communism Warsav Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia

         The invasion successfully stopped Prague Spring liberalisation reforms and strengthened the authority of the authoritarian wing within the KSČ.
        The communist party was losing influence and it's impact,wasn't as much as in 1948.
        People could start a small business and there were bright chance,on new democracy.
        The communist party couldn't allow this and called to Warsav Pact for help.
        Pact then mobilize the army and moved it's forces into the Czechoslovakia,
        for defeating "capitalism that was beginning its roots" as communist manifesto said.

## The creation of Czech Republic

         On the 17. November the Velvet Revolution began as non-violent protest and transition of power from Communist party.
        They announced that they would seize all their power and end to the one-party state.
        All the barbered wire obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December.
        On 29. December the Václav Havel was elected on the President of Czechoslovakia.
        In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946.On 1. January , Czechslovakia split into two countries.

## Capital City Prague

         The Capital city of Czech Republic is Prague as were in it right now.It's the largest city,
        and I in my honest opinnion the most beutifful one in Czech Republic.
        The city has warm summers and chilly winters.Prague is political, cultural and economic centre of central Europe,
        with rich history. Prague is home to a number of well-known cultural attractions,
        many of which survived the violence and destruction of 20th-century Europe.
        Main attractions include Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, Old Town Square with Prague astronomical clock
        Petřín hill and Vyšehrad. For me it's Petřín hill which I like the most.I have really good memories and stories on it.
        I had a date that went very well and was very romantic.As we were gazing on Prague, laying in grass and eating bagguete with blue cheese,
        and talking about future plans and how We gonna live our lives. And i think I had visited a pub on top of the hill with guys and
        I don't think I need to explain how that went.I am from village named Libeń that is close to Dolní Břežany that is home toIf anyone of you heard
        about ELI centre or more famously called "The biggest laser in Centre Europe".It's like hour and half from Palacky's square.
        But one bus can take you as far as Modřany are.

## Government

         Let's talk about favorite czech subject : The politics. We are parliamentary representative democratic state.
        The Parliament is made of two parts.The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.The Chamber of Deputies has 200 seats and its members are
        elected for four year term.The senate has 81 seats and it's members are elected for six year term with one third changed every even year.
        The Parliament is making proposal on law and if they agree on it they send it to senate for agreement.If they don't agree it's returned to Parliament.
        And it continues like that.We have president who is right now Miloš Zeman and his main purpose is to represent country in foreign countries,
        and doesn't wield as much power as in America or France.But with Prime minister their signatures can make something.
        President is also head of Military of Czech Republic.We have also prime minister whose role is to appoint other ministersand cabinet.
        The Cabinet must receive confidence from the Chamber of Deputies and the Prime Minister stays in office,
        only as long as he or she retains the support of a majority of its members.

## Characterize the country and some interesting people

         It's no secret that czech people love bear and food rich on fat and carbs.The second type Diabettes is represented , but I think that
        health standard is improving.During the lockdown I was suprised by how many people started exercising.It's for speculation if they started
        because of mental problems or physical.I exercised a lot during quarantine.I was really angry and I needed a way to get it of me.
        I went running often too.And I started long walks with my dog where we would lost on some field and just go in direction without purpose or end.
        The long walks into the unknown are really good on mindfullness and sorting thoughts.I can't say that one day I won't leave Czech republic.
        I would really like to but , I don't think that it is in nearly future. I am thinking about starting in another country from zero,
        but I don't think that it is rational.Is it better to travel and maybe move now or after 10 years.What would slow me and hurt me more.
        And I would say that I am someone who take risks.

# 4. USA

## Let's start with some basic information

        USA or United States of America is a country primarily located in North America
        consisting of 50 states. it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area
        population is almost 328,000,000 people, it is the third most populous country in the world
        The national capital is Washington, D.C. In USA 78% people speak English and 14% Spaish and 
        other 14% people speak other languages like chinese, korean, french 

## Now i am going to talk somthing about history

        The first known use of the name "America" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world 
        map created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller. In 1538, the Flemish 
        cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name "America" on his own world map.
        The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" dates from a
        January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan, Esquire, to George Washington's
        aide-de-camp (pobočník) Joseph Reed.

## in USA took place  Several wars

        in 1775 - 1783 began American Revolutionary War which established 
        independence. by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal 
        in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the 
        American Civil War led to its abolition.The Spanish–American War and World War I 
        established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of 
        World War II. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged 
        in various proxy wars but avoided direct military conflict

## Let's talk about education in USA

        American public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated 
        by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants.
        In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven
        until they turn 18; some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.
        About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. 
        Just over 2% of children are homeschooled. The U.S. spends more on education per 
        student than any nation in the world, spending an average of $12,794 per year 
        on public elementary and secondary school. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated
        from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and
        9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%

## Now let's move on to goverment and politics

        The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories.
        It is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative
        democracy "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.
        In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of 
        government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly 
        split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive 
        and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district

# 5. The United Kingdom

## Basic information

         United kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.
         The United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the northeastern part of the island of Ireland,
        and many smaller islands within the British Isles.The United Kingdom consists of four countries:
        England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland
        which is the independent state.The population is around 66 millions.In the head of United Kingdom is Elizabeth II.
        (who was reigned since 1952 )with current prime minister Boris Johnson.The United Kingdom's capital is London,
        a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 milion.There are also 14 British Overseas Territories,
        the last remnants of British Empire which at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass,
        and was the largest empire in history.British influence can be observed in the language,
        culture and political systems of many of its former colonies.

## Important history events

         On 1. May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed,
        the result of Acts of Union being passed by parliamnets of England and Scotland to ratify the 1706 Treaty of Union,
        and so unite the two kingdoms.Treaty of Union consisted of:

        - Scotland and England should be united into one of name Great Britain 
        - provided Scotland peers to have the same rights as English peers 
        - provided Scotland to be represented in the new Parliament of Great Britain by sixteen of its peers and forty-five members of House of Commons
               
        The term 'United Kingdom' became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union,
        uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
        After the defeat of France at the end of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815),
        the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century. British dominance was later described as British Peace,
        a period of relative peace among the Great Powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman.

## First World War

         Britain fought alongside France, Russia and (after 1917) the United States,
        against Germany and its allies in the First World War.British forces were engaged
        across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe,particularly on the Western front.
        The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men,
        with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order.

         After the war, Britain received the League of Nations mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies.
        The British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.
        Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.
        Interesting fact that I don't think everyone knews is that Anglo-Japanese Alliance that bound (1902-1923)
        Britain and Japan to assist one another in safuarding their respective interest in China and Korea.
        Directed against Russian expansionism in the Far East,it was a cornerstone of British and Japanese policy in Asia
        until after World War I.After the war the British no longer feared Russian encroachment in China
        and wished to maintain close ties with the United States, which tended to view Japan as its rival in the Pacific.

## Second World War

         After Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Britain entered the Second World War by declaring war on Germany in 1939.
        Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940.
        Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war,
        Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany.
        Churchill engaged indurstry, scientists, and engineers to advise and support the government
        and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.In 1940 british RAF defeated German Luftwaffe
        in a struggle of controling British skies.Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz.
        British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan an the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea.
        British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project which led to the surrender of Japan.

## Government and Politics

         The United Kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy. Queen Elizabeth II.
        is the monarch and head of the UK, as well as 15 other indepndent countries. These 16 countries
        are sometimes referred to as "Commonwealth realms". The monarch has "the right to be consulted,
        the right to encourage, and the right to warn".The UK Parliament can perform "constitutional reform"
        simply by passing Acts of Parliament,and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost
        any written or unwritten element of the constitution. No Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change

## Characterize the country

         Firstword some facts:

        - Today the Uk is the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany.
        - There is around 60% chritstian and 25% none.Life expentancy at birth is 80 years.
        - Obesity over people 28% which is worser than Czechia by 3%.
        - Uneployment rate is 3.17% which is insignificantly worser than czechia.
 
         The United Kingdom has been born country to many scients and great minds.
        For Example:
        Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science.

        Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology. // TODO: 

        James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory //TODO: 

        And my favorite Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of astronomy,
        quantum gravity and investigation of black holes and black hole evaporation of it called Hawking radiation. // TODO: 

        //TODO: Beatless

         Education in United Kingdom is a devolded matter with each country having a separate education system.
        Considering the four systems together, about 38 % of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree,
        Which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.
        I think everyone knows tho major universities: Cambridge and Oxford.In my honest opinion Cambridge is better.
        Stephen Hawking studied there which is the first thing. The architecture is beautiful.I have been there personally,
        and I think the school ground are more sympathic.

# 7. Work and business

WORK AND BUSINESS
-------------------------------------------------------

What is work

Work is intentional activity people perform to support 
themselves, others, or the needs and wants of a wider community.
Alternatively, work can be viewed as the human activity that contributes 
towards the goods and services within an economy.

Work is fundamental to all societies, but can vary widely within and between 
them, from gathering in natural resources by hand, to operating complex 
technologies that substitute for physical or even mental effort by many human 
beings. All but the simplest tasks also require specific skills, equipment or 
tools, and other resources 

Because sustained effort is a necessary part of many human activities, what qualifies
as work is often a matter of context. Specialization is one common feature that 
distinguishes work from other activities. For example, a sport is a job for a professional 
athlete who earns their livelihood from it, but a hobby to someone playing for fun in 
their community

What is business

Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying 
and selling products (such as goods and services). Simply it is "any activity or 
enterprise entered into for profit."

Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means
that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the 
business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's 
personal possessions. 

The term is also often used to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, 
is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate 
tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers 
more protection and benefits for the owner.

Finance

Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics 
of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty 
and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management

Maketing

The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a 
market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well 
as determining product pricing.

Sales

Sales are activity related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a 
given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key 
to a companies' success.

Employment

is a relationship between two parties, usually based on contract where work is paid 
for, where one party, which may be a corporation, for profit, not-for-profit organization, 
or other entity is the employer and the other is the employee. 
Employees work in return for payment, which may be in the form of an hourly wage, by 
piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does or which 
sector they are working in. Employees in some fields or sectors may receive gratuities, 
bonus payment or stock options. In some types of employment, employees may receive 
benefits in addition to payment. Benefits can include health insurance, housing, 
disability insurance or use of a gym. Employment is typically governed by employment 
laws, organisation or legal contracts.



# 8. Information Technology

## Basic definition

         it is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data or information.It is typically used to business,
        personal, or entertainment technologies. This includes many technologies and is on multiple leves on interaction.I would say that,
        posibilities in ICT are endless as human mind.We use it to every day every second, and I would speculate that is making us,
        forget more and remember less because we have all info in our pockets right? We don't have to learn so much facts as you can in 10
        seconds google the information.What would you do with information who was 1. American president when you don't have to remember it.
        You will forget it unless you are using it.I don't think it's a problem.It will be problem when we will have to use our memory again.
        I would redirect this discussion to ICT in learning/schools if you don't mind? You have student's that won't learn and will struggle,
        during elementary schools, because of the facts that they need to learn.And you have kids that won't find it dificulty at all.
        I think we need to learn more concepts as it is easier to store and learn.The facts are always second.If you know how something works,
        how it operates what to do and what not, You won't find facts more difficult.Facts are from concept.And human mind learns concept whole life.
        The more computer teachers (no offense) are used to send links to onedrive and use google meets or teams as fish in water.And if they find problem
        they google it.I would compare it to software engineer job.We are solving problems everyday (not all of us) and we are making concepts but syntax,
        or some info that is neceseary during realization we don't remember.So we google it find solution and implement.
        It is important to google steps or bugs rather than  google and steal the whole solution.

## History

         We could talk about FM radio and electo tubes and morse code but I think we'll skip that.

        - First concept of computer that is somewhat understandable,is from Alan Turing who conseptualises the computing machine.
        - After the war the first programmable computer the Manchester Mark 1 is created.
        - In 1951 is created the first computer in the world to allow users to input commands with keyboard.
        - 1956 first hard disk by IBM
        - Silicon Chip the first integrated circuit
        - First computer mouse on world in 1963
        - 1971 Email invented and Intel 4004 first commecially used microprocessor
        - 1975 the most world famous mcu the MOS Technology 6502
         // APPLE TODO:
        Let's talk about last for bit.In 70s and 80s there were very expensive mcu from Intel and Motorola.Far from affordable for normal customer or geek.
        Ex-employes of these two companies created company MOS Technology which cutted expenses from Motorola 68000 and Intel 8008 300 dollars to 20 .
        I hope you can imagine the exicement for electronic geeks and hobyists. They started clubs and printing cicuit board and build of something beatifull.

## Everyday Use

        Now let's talk about everyday use sources of everyday using.I count and I hope that everyone in this room owns a smartphone.If anyone disagree raise your hand? No one ? Good.So what is the first thing you do in the morning? Do you stretch your body or just close your eyes and slowly wake up?Maybe you jump out of your bed and start making it and I think that is the best start.But I don't think that at least one person out of this room starts his day by looking at notifications on his phone or start scrolling through Instagram or Facebook.My day starts and opening my eyes looking at time how much time I spent in limbo and then taking my phone and looking on world news and what happened during my sleep.I don't really consider this a bad habit, but nothing would happen during my wake up phase.
        Let's return to your everyday using.I have some lifehacks for you to use on your phone.First thing that will tell you a lot is a Time management app.The one I use is RescueTime which you can install in smartphone IOS or Android,Linux MacOS or Windows.It will map every app you use, but not the data or track you for ads. It's dashboard shows every page from very productive to veru unprodactive and shows you different tabs for every app. Next app that will improve your sleep very notably.It's called night shift basiclly.It eliminates blue light and replaces is it with more hot colors.It won't significantly 
        reduce the creation of melatonin that is sleep hormone that is making you sleepier. These are the most basic ones

## Connection between information Technology and everyday user

        Well you probably have a microsoft account from school and maybe your personal and maybe if you have side job you are using it's tools to comunicate and work with your collegues. It has cloud storage, emails, communicative groups with file sharing and quick videochats.It is really good system which even includes online word editor and powerpoint, table software. 

## Social media

        If anyone of you doesn't use any social media raise your hand.No one.That says something.You use it why.For communicating with your friends?Because your children use it?Or because of the information you can get from there? These are all understandeble reasons why you would use such a thing.Let's take the oldest and still used today.Facebook by Mark Zuckerberk is the most popular. It has groups, pages around some theme where people add posts. and it has your page and it's friends. It is around year 2004 so like 16 years old. It collects your personal data and if you have it open it tracks what you browser for advertisement purposes.I don't really like it and I have all trackers and cookies blocked.Most of my age group moved to instagram as many older generation moved to facebook.Instagram on other hand is better as it only has pictures and messaging and My age group probably doesn't need any more of it.There is also messenger which everyone uses but it is separted from facebook as much as it can be.And people don't trust it, but use it which is funny.        
        
# 9. Energy Sources


They can be divided by type into fossil fuel, nuclear fuel and renewable resources.

Fossil fuel
-------------------------
A fossil fuel is a fuel formed by natural processes, such as  decomposition of 
buried dead organisms, containing organic molecules originating in ancient 
photosynthesis that release energy in combustion. Such organisms and their resulting 
fossil fuels typically have an age of millions of years, and sometimes more than 650 
million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include 
petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Peat is also sometimes considered a fossil fuel. 
Commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane. Fossil fuels 
range from volatile materials with low carbon-to-hydrogen ratios, to liquids , to 
nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon. Methane can be found in 
hydrocarbon fields alone, associated with oil.

Coal

Coal is the most abundant and burned fossil fuel. This was the fuel that launched 
the industrial revolution and continued to grow in use; China, which already has many 
of the world's most polluted cities, was in 2007 building about two coal-fired power 
plants every week.6] Coal's large reserves would make it a popular candidate to meet 
the energy demand of the global community, short of global warming concerns and other 
pollutants.

Natural gas

Natural gas is a widely available fossil fuel. Improvements in technology and wide 
exploration led to a major increase in recoverable natural gas reserves as 
shale fracking methods were developed. At present usage rates, natural gas could 
supply most of the world's energy needs for between 100 and 250 years, depending on 
increase in consumption over time.

Petroleum

is a naturally occurring, yellowish-black liquid found in geological formations beneath
the Earth's surface. It is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of 
petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation, i.e. separation 
of a liquid mixture into fractions differing in boiling point by means of distillation, 
typically using a fractionating column. It consists of naturally occurring hydrocarbons 
of various molecular weights and may contain miscellaneous organic compounds. A fossil 
fuel, petroleum is formed when large quantities of dead organisms, mostly zooplankton 
and algae, are buried underneath sedimentary rock and subjected to both intense heat 
and pressure.

Nuclear energy
-------------------------

is material used in nuclear power stations to produce heat to power turbines. 
Heat is created when nuclear fuel undergoes nuclear fission.

Most nuclear fuels contain heavy fissile actinide elements that are capable of 
undergoing and sustaining nuclear fission. When the unstable nuclei of these atoms 
are hit by a slow-moving neutron, they split, creating two daughter nuclei and two 
or three more neutrons. These neutrons then go on to split more nuclei. This creates 
a self-sustaining chain reaction that is controlled in a nuclear reactor, or 
uncontrolled in a nuclear weapon.

Renewable resources
-------------------------

A renewable resource is a natural resource which will replenish to replace the 
portion depleted by usage and consumption, either through natural reproduction or 
other recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. 
Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest 
components of its ecosphere. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of 
a resource's sustainability.

Solar energy

Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range 
of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, solar thermal energy, solar 
architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.

It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly c
haracterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture 
and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.

Wind power

is the use of wind to provide mechanical power through wind turbines to turn electric 

# 10. The living environment and its protection

## Basic Definition

         In my opinion I would define living environment as all nature, animals
        and all people and their actions to whetever they add or remove the
        level of health of the environment.Due to the pressure of overconsumption, population growth and tehcnology, the environemtn is being degraded, sometimes permanently.This has been recognized, however not that much as We would like to.Governments have begun placing restraints on activites that cause enviromental damage.Since 1960's movements have created more awareness of the multiple environmental problems. There is disagreement on the extent of the environmental impat of human activity, so protection measures are occasionally debated.

## Covid-19 and it's impact on living environment

        I think everyone took notice of improvmenet our home isolation brought.The air was cleaner by 17% of CO2 as people weren't so much driving.Animals on every part of world started coming to cities.Maybe it was because they weren't distracted by people or they were visiting but people finally saw it.I got to know one interesting word and I am really keen on discoreving if you know it.Do you know term Ecoccide?It means willingly causing or ordering the causing of widespread, long-term , severe damage to the natural environment.Ecoccide is not recognized as a punishable crime by the United Nations and is not part of International Law.

        Deforestation 2020: the year of fire.Our planet never experienced such increased wildfire rates and sizes of areas affected by fires. It first started with Indonesia and Australia.And it continued with Argentina, the Amazons and California. The fires have burnt 8.5 million hectares across six states, and it is estimated to lead to the deaths of more than one billion native animals.This is the highest recorded for the past 20 years.

        As last well known: Plastic Pollution.Plastic has just been aroud for 100 years, and it is the most signifficant environmental impact of 2020.Another interesting fact by how much of face masks and gloves are disposed every month due to pandemic.Most gloves end up in our rivers and oceans, as there is no solution to recycle such items.On top of that, masks can be confounded with jellyfishses by turtles as it is their favourite food.Due to plastic beign cheeper the output of plastic food bowls and dishes is going to product 30% more than in year 2019.
        
        I have actually a story that shows this problem at incredible level.I have been on my first scuba diving holliday in Vrsar, Croatia.It gave me some lifechanging experience.Every dive from first to last I tried to separate from my group and with my dive buddy we collected plastics and every derbish we could found.Every dive our lifevests were full of plastic masks,bags, straws and bowls.It was disgusting.Even when we were freediving in our free time between dives we found plastic.Even at my first night dive I collected.This was a eye openner for me.It showed me how excuse me'fucked' up situation is.I can't image what is deeper in the ocean.Of course the taking anything from ocean or destroying corals holding them or posing with them for photo is prohibited.

## Some everyday problems that we need to solve

        Biggest envrironment problem is polution.It kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year.The Air that we are breathing contains high levels of pollutants.Nine of ten people are breathing levels of polution that would not be considered safe by WHO.The main cause is by burning fossil fuels.Another reason is by using fertilizers and pesticides.They emit harmful chemicals into the air and can also cause water pollution.I'm sure that you heard that the one pesticide commonly used named Roundup is marked as cancer causitive.Which is really bad if you have garden or growing zones and you need to protect them from pest attacks.

        The one of the outcomes from the air pollution and the climate going is the ice melting.It is long term problem and wildly known fact is that sea level is on 1mm per year.Which doesn't seem a lot but your children will already know the difference.

        High level of wasting.You most probably waste.Everyone does it. It is normal that things that not have purpose anymore are thrown to trash.We don't think for another purpose of things and we are eager to spend more resources on things that could be with small effort changed to different function.For example jars from cucumbers could be used to store any kind of think to kitchen.I am not trying to say to store empty markers or used tea bags.I am trying to say that you should transform your homestead to 21st century of energy saving and minimal wastes.

## Greenpeace and other movements

        We have all kinds of movements from environmental protection.The well-known is Greenpeace who have been enganing this problem from 1970.Their first action was taking an old fisherman boat and going to Amchitka island that were used for nuclear bomb testing and was populated with endagered sea otters and home for many birds.They were forced back as soon as their entered the area by us navy ship but their voices had been heard and Island was later declared as bird sanctuary.One of the most famous causes have been for seal skin trade.In 1992 on Canadian new foundland island is having a skin seal pup seasons.It was massive killing of seals just for their skin.Greenpeace released the photo of them spraying the green paint on their skin which is environmental friendly and pup skins are nothing for skinners.

## Extremely protecting vs Modest protection

        No one can use every thing and don't product any trash or polution.If you think about it phylosophically every step you take in prague is producing polution.Every step on everything outside the park is going to damage the thing that will need repair after some years in which your steps helped it.If you think about it like this it can destroy you.Greenpeace is really extremist organization which is effective and people will always like group harm rich and powerfull.It is partyzain tactic and they have people voice. You can undergo some procedures which will improve it but you don't need it to master.

## Extremist Ecoterrorism

        I don't for anyone to cause chaos and damage anyone even if it is for future of our children and for better tommorows.You cannot do anything that way.These people are terrorists no matter the reason.That's the reason France sunked the Greenpeace boat during their first nuclear test to show their nuclear arsenal.The boat rainbow warrior was non repairable damaged and one photographer died.
        The fault is on both sides in my honest opinion.You take risks doing illegal actions.The France navy shouldn't openned fire on unarmed ship but that ship had no permision for being in military space.

## Conclusion

        I try my best to don't throw out neccesery things and be energy efficient as possible.I am active in ocean protection groups and I am singing petitions on making ocean reservations for proteting marine life.In my dives I would like to focus in my life on helping with cleaning the ocean because everyone of us owns a piece of it.It is the price for living in civilization and each of you has to pay for it.One way or another.

## Overview

        Our health consists of one thing that is the most precious thing we own.It affects us, it controls us, and we behave as we are feeling.We were given only once the health if you are not offended by this statement.

## How to care about health

        In order to be healthy and to constantly improve your health you should exercise regularly, increase constantly your trainings, and eat helthy.Even the best can't last a diet.Diets are scientficilly proven to not work, because we cannot hold up to them.It's funny when someone decisively states that he is on the diet.He can't last.To move somewhere.Metabolism is an interesting thing.It's ability to burn fat.From our predecesors we have an ability to store fat for immidiet use and for worse times.Some of us have to exercise regularly and primarily cardio to stay slim.It's genetic if you have slow or fast metabolism.You can't do something about it.You can increase the burn rate by cardio after workout and regular cardio.Also at least 10000 steps per day helps it.You can also slow you metabolism.If you intentionally slow it by holding breaths or slowing your heart rate.For example free divers have big health problems with this and also brain damage in included.

## Some common health problems in our population

        Let's face it the overweight is the biggest problem not talking about Covid-19 as I am sure you dont want to hear it, because you heard it and will hear it. Second biggest problem is high blood pressure.I won't mention addictions, that's completely different subject. I don't really wish to speak about this problem.You know all things we should and shouldn't. With High blood pressure it is complicated, it's mostly chronical or made by smoking/alcohol.These are logical population problems and it could be worse.More illnesses and less vaccinations.

## First aid

        Everyone should know the basics of CPR. Perform heart resuscitaion or make breathing possible.
