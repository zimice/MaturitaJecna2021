I would like to talk about my opinion of this subject.

-  My way of education
-  My path to this school
-  How I learn to everyday subjects

## My way of education
My elementary school have been close to my village and has been the biggest one in whole district.I have been going there for nine years and have enjoyed every day.I have made very close friend there and I hope I will never forget the experience I have got there.

## My path to this school
In ninth grade I have made a choice to go to Smíchovská střední průmyslová škola or to SPŠE Ječná.I have choosen this school as this was more to my interest because of the electrotechnics subjects.I haven't made it at first but I kept on trying and eventualy I have been accepted.

## How I learn to everyday subjects
Every day when I get out of school and come home a revise the subjects that I am interested in.
